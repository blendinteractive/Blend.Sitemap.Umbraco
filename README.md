This is a lightweight package that enables /sitemap.xml at the root of an Umbraco website, supporting multisite environments and culture-specific URLs. This package is configured using appSettings.

Command Line
```
dotnet add package Our.Umbraco.Blend.Sitemap
```

Or Nuget
```
Install-Package Our.Umbraco.Blend.Sitemap
```

## Setup
---
In the `Startup.cs` there is a configuration you need to add for `/sitemap.xml` path to render.

In the `app.UseUmbraco()` Under `.WithEndpoints(u =>` add:
```
u.EndpointRouteBuilder.MapControllers();
```
This will use the route `/sitemap.xml` declared in the controller.

## Default
---
If there are no settings for the sitemap in the `appSettings.json` file nothing will be dispalyed.

## Configuration
---
In the root of your `appSettings.json` you can configure custom settings. You can also use `appSettings.[Environment].json` to have specific settings for every environment.

`Sitemap` is the root object and is required.

`Sitemap.CacheMinutes` is an optional integer. When filled in the sitemap will be cached for that many minutes before rebuilding.

If left blank the default is 15 minutes.

`Sitemap.IncludePageDocuments` is an optional boolean default false. When true will add document that isn't an image type as a url with the same changeFrequency and priority as the document it was referenced on.

`Sitemap.DocumentTypes` is a required array of document type groups to be in the sitemap. Each group change frequency and priority will apply to that group's aliases.
